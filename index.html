        but some problems occurred that led to the separation of some individuals, and the team suffered for three years until
        <mark>2018</mark>.
         With the return of Commander Karim after his very serious injury, the team’s conditions improved to the best.
         <mark>By 5 years</mark> ,
          the team members managed to reach perfection football until we played 301 matches, we were able to win
           <mark>301</mark> matches, draw
           <mark>11 matches</mark>,
           and lose in only11 matches <mark>3</mark>  matches, and we were the best and most developed team in this period.<Br>

        Karim Mohamed:

Born in Alexandria Egypt in may 2002<br>

Kisho is a founder of the club and he is the captain too 

And he is the most scorer player in the team history with 301 in only 230 match <br>

He leaved the team in 2016 and back again in 2021 

Back then the team was relegated to the second division<br>


Because there was a lot of  transfers and the escape of players from the  
team such as "Nour" and "Adel" Because of the team's reliance on new attackers<br> and the lack of a playmaker

And they want to have a chance<br>

But kisho back for the first time in 2021 

And he was just like a hero for the team 

He bring the team soul and he can led the team to the first division again<br>

He is the most player who love the team and always try his best the team 

He always says if you want stop my steps when I'm in the cage with bany haigan name 

Try to cut my leg easier</div>
